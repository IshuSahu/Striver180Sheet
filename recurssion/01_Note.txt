What is the difference between recursion and iteration?
Key Differences Between Recursion and Iteration? Recursion is a technique in which the function calls itself in its body to solve the problem, typically breaking into smaller and more manageable sub-problems. In contrast, Iteration is a technique that repetitively executes a code block until the condition is unmet

Great questions! Let‚Äôs break this down step by step so you can deeply understand recursion, how to recognize when to use it, and how to approach recursion-based problems.

 üìå What is Recursion?

 Definition: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the original problem, breaking it down into base cases and recursive cases.

 Why use recursion?

   When a problem can be divided into smaller, similar sub-problems.
   Often used in problems involving trees, graphs, combinations, permutations, divide-and-conquer (e.g., quicksort, mergesort), etc.

Steps to Approach a Recursion Problem

 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understand the Problem Structure

 Ask: Can the problem be broken down into smaller subproblems of the same type?
 Look for repeated substructures (e.g., smaller versions of the original input).

 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Base Case

 The simplest input for which the solution is obvious and doesn‚Äôt require further recursion.
 Examples:

   Factorial: `factorial(0) = 1`
   Fibonacci: `fib(0) = 0`, `fib(1) = 1`
   Tree traversal: If `node == null`, return.

 3Ô∏è‚É£ Define the Recursive Case

 How do you reduce the problem size and call the function again?
 Combine solutions of smaller subproblems to form the final solution.

 4Ô∏è‚É£ Think about the Pattern

 Common recursive patterns:

   Decision Tree: Explore all possible choices (e.g., subsets, permutations, backtracking).
   Divide-and-Conquer: Break problem into two or more subproblems (e.g., binary search, mergesort).
   Tree/Graph Traversal: Visit nodes/edges recursively.

 5Ô∏è‚É£ Use Recursion When:

 The problem is naturally hierarchical (e.g., tree).
 Problem involves choices at each step (e.g., subsets, permutations).
 Can divide the problem into smaller, similar problems.
 You need to explore all possible combinations.

 6Ô∏è‚É£ Be Cautious!

 Avoid infinite recursion by ensuring a base case is always reached.
 Consider time and space complexity ‚Äì recursion can cause exponential time or stack overflow if not controlled.
 If overlapping subproblems occur (e.g., Fibonacci), consider memoization (dynamic programming).

 üìå Recognizing Patterns Requiring Recursion

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tree-like structure     | Data organized as nodes/children. (e.g., Tree traversal)      |
| All combinations        | You need to try all possible subsets or arrangements.         |
| Breaking problem down   | Can be reduced to smaller subproblems (e.g., divide array)    |
| Choices at each step    | At each decision point, multiple options (e.g., backtracking) |
| Graph exploration       | Need to traverse edges/nodes in a graph.                      |
| Mathematical recurrence | Formula depends on previous terms (e.g., Fibonacci)           |
